Turtle Graphics with DirectX

Requires net48 developer things and Windows.
It would be nice some day with an OpenGL version on .net core that could run on anything, but with DirectX
we are Windows-only.

To run:
```
dotnet run --project .\Turtles.DirectX\Turtles.DirectX.fsproj
```
Depending on how it is being run, it could run full screen and you must use alt+f4 to kill it again, but I would
worry more about it not building than being able to stop the program to be honest...
